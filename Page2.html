            <h2>Cepheid Variable stars (Intrinsic Variable)<br><span>A long time ago astronomers couldn't tell how faraway most of the stars were when they
                looked up into the night sky. They could only measure distance within a few hundred light
                years.</span></h2>
            <h2><span>In 1912 all of this changed when a researcher named Henrietta Leavitt noted a small
                relatively unknown group of stars known as Cepheid variables, these stars brighten and dim
                periodically.</span></h2>
            <h2><span>Cepheid variables are considered a special variable stars because their period, Cepheid
                period is the time they take to brighten, dim and brighten again. Leavitt was able to measure
                the period of each star by measuring the timing of its ups and downs in brightness. What she
                determined was that the brighter the Cepheid, the longer its period.</span></h2>
            <h2><span>Cepheid's brightness change occur due to helium in the Star's atmosphere when the helium
                is heated it becomes more opaque making the Cepheid dimmer and when it cools it becomes
                transparent making the Cepheid brighter.</span></h2>
            <h2><span>The change in brightness of a Cepheid over time can be plotted on a light curve which is a
                graph that show the brightness of an object over a period of time</span></h2>
