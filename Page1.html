            <h2>Cataclysmic Variables (CVs)
            <br><span>Cataclysmic variables (CVs) are binary star systems which consists of two stars that
              are gravitationally bound to and in orbit around each other, in the night sky the stars are seen as
              a single object from earth. The entire binary system is usually the size of the Earth-Moon system
              with an orbital period of 1 to 10 hours.

            <h2><span>Cataclysmic variables have a white dwarf and a normal star . The white dwarf is often
              referred to as the "primary" star, and the normal star as the "companion" or the "secondary" star.
              The companion star, a star that is "normal," like our Sun, loses material onto the white dwarf
              via accretion. Since the white dwarf is very dense, the gravitational potential energy is
              enormous, and some of it is converted into X-rays during the accretion process. There are
              probably more than a million of these cataclysmic variables in the galaxy, but only those near
              our Sun have been studied in X-rays so far. This is because CVs are fairly faint in X-rays.</span></h2>
